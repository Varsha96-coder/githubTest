### *what is Browser Rendering?*
    Browser Rendering is the process for rendering a specific web page requested by the user in the browser. It interprets HTML and XML documents along with the images that are styled or formatted using CSS.Thus, it gives a final layout which is display on the user interface. 

    As the user requests for any document, the rendering engine starts fetching the content.
    This is done via the networking layer.

Process of Browser Rendering:
> * The browser first reads the text written in HTML when a web page is loaded.
> * It then contructs DOM Tree from it.
> * Then it checks for CSS whether it is inline, embedded, or external.
> * Constructs the CSSOM Tree from it.
> * It constructs the Render-Tree from it after these trees get constructed.

### Before describing about the whole process on rendering, let us know about some terms:

Terms | Description
------------ | -------------
Html | HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.
CSS | CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. It saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
JavaScript| JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web. It can update and change both HTML and CSS. It can calculate, manipulate and validate data.
DOM | The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.


##  Mechanism behind the rendering services of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to DOM:

> Construction of DOM
> *  When the renderer process receives a commit message for a navigation and starts to receive HTML data, the main thread begins to parse the text string (HTML) and turn it into a Document Object Model (DOM).
> * Parsing an HTML document into a DOM is defined by the HTML Standard. We may have noticed that feeding HTML to a browser never throws an error. For example, missing closing paragraph tag is a valid HTML. This is because the HTML specification is designed to handle those errors gracefully. 

> Subresource loading
>* A website usually uses external resources like images, CSS, and JavaScript. Those files need to be loaded from network or cache. 
>* The main thread could request them one by one as they find them while parsing to build a DOM.
>* If there are things like <img> or <link> in the HTML document, preload scanner peeks at tokens generated by HTML parser and sends requests to the network thread in the browser process.

> JavaScript can block the parsing
>* When the HTML parser finds a *script* tag, it pauses the parsing of the HTML document and has to load, parse, and execute the JavaScript code.
>* JavaScript can change the shape of the document using things like document.write() which changes the entire DOM structure
>* This is why the HTML parser has to wait for JavaScript to run before it can resume parsing of the HTML document.
